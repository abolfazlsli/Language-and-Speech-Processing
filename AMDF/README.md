# Audio Analysis with AMDF

This project analyzes an audio signal using the Average Magnitude Difference Function (AMDF). It visualizes both the original audio signal and its AMDF.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- librosa
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your audio file in the project directory and update the `file_path` variable in the script to point to your audio file.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python audio_analysis.py
```

3. The script will display the original audio signal and its AMDF plot.

## Notes

- The audio file should be in WAV format.
- The script currently processes the first 2000 samples of the audio signal.
- The sampling rate is set to 16000 Hz.

### Instructions

1. Create a file named `README.md` and copy the content above into it.
2. Create a file named `requirements.txt` and copy the content above into it.
3. Make sure to adjust the `file_path` variable in your script to point to the correct audio file you want to analyze.
```
This should help users understand how to set up and use your audio analysis code!
